# Big Project : Colorado College Basketball API
This is a simple API that gets information about players on the CC basketball team. 

I built this by creating a web server in C, and displaying data stored in JSON files. 

Methods:

/getMens : Return roster of mens basketball team

/getWomens : Return roster of womens basketball team

To run:
 
```
./api
```

Open on localhost:3000
